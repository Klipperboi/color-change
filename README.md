# ADVANCED (SAME LAYER) COLOR CHANGE

No matter how good your printer is tuned, the 1st layer, with the bed texture will always look better than the top one. 
That being said, if you want to make nice things that have color changes, you should take advantage of that thing, and organise the color changes to be made on the 1st layer, rather than having them made the simple way, at the top, with layer changes. 

Before you start, you should make sure that you have the adequate color change gcode in Printer settings > Machine G-code > Change filament G-code
